# The Manor - a text-based mysterious horror game
Game Description: <br>

You are a private investigative journalist, one day you received an anonymous e-mail from someone asking you to investigate an old private abandoned manor owned by a tycoon back in the 1800s with a dark and sinister past. It was whispered that the manor was a hub for illicit activities, crimes and the secret gatherings of a clandestine cult. Rumor had it that the tycoon had met a gruesome end at the hands of his own wife, who had discovered his infidelity. In her despair, she had taken her own life along with her innocent sons, casting an everlasting shadow over the estate. <br>

The anonymous sender promised you something extraordinary - an unimaginable sum of money that would be wired to you if you took up the challenge of investigating the forsaken manor.<br>

Tempted by greed, and having financial struggles at that time. You decided to take the offer to investigate the manor and unravel the mysteries surrounding the abandoned estate, to shine a light on the dark secrets that lay hidden within its decaying walls. Little do you know what awaits on the other side of the wall.
